################### Lists ###################
Lists are ordered, accessible by indexes, can contain any type of objects, and are mutable.
================================================================
===  Create List  ===
================================================================
  # Empty List:
    L = []

  # List can be mixed data types:
    L = [ 1, 'abc', 1.23, (3+4j), True]

  # Converting from other types through list() constructor:
    L = list('abc')

  # Nested List:
    L = ['a', ['bb', ['ccc', 'ddd'], 'ee', 'ff'], 'g', 'h']

  # Slicing and existing list also returns in a new list.


================================================================
===  Accessing List Elements  ===
================================================================
  # Accessing List elements:
    =  Elements can be accessed by index, starting at 0.

    =  Elements can be accessed by negative indexes can be used as well.
        Last element can be accessed from index starting from -1.

    =  Accessing nested elements: L[2][2][0].

    =  out of bound error is raised when you access outside of index.


================================================================
===  List Slicing  ===
================================================================
  #  List Slicing:
    =  L[n:m] returns the part of the list from the “n-th” item to the “m-1 th” item.

    =  print(L[3:-1]): You can mix positive and negative indexes.
        Just that, from index should be greater than to index.

    = no error raised when you try to slice out of bound indexes.


================================================================
===  Modifying a List  ===
================================================================
  #  L[0] = 'orange'; L[-1] = 'violet'

  #  L.append(<item>): adds item to the end of the list.
    =  If they <item> is a list, the whole list is appended as a single element.

  #  L.insert(<index>, <item>): To insert an item at a specific index.
      All the elements from the index are shifted to the right.

  #  Out of bound error is raised when you try to insert at out of bound index.

  #  L1.extend(L2) or L1 += L2 or L1 = L1 + 2 can be used to add elements from an iterable to existing list
    =  Each element of Iterable are added as individual elements to the List.
